## About

S.W.A.T is a game I developed as part of a group using the Unity engine and C#.

The robbers are trying to break into valuable locations such as banks and villas using explosive charges. The player must clear the location of enemies while also trying to make sure to not hit any hostages which will fail the level. The explosive device must also be found and defused before the timer ends or it will explode, failing the mission.
